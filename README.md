SummerCourses
=============

##The Project
This is my third year team software project.

The code was written by [ChengXi Bao](https://github.com/happlebao) and I. 

It was my first attempt at a rails app and my time using Ruby. I had lots of fun making it but I'm sure there are plenty of novice mistakes!

##The Brief
There is a copy of the [[Project-Brief]].

##Deployment
This rails app is automatically deployed to Heroku on each push to master. The address is: [summercourses.herokuapp.com](https://summercourses.herokuapp.com/).

Primitive deployment logs are [here](http://cs1.ucc.ie/~jct1/git_call)
